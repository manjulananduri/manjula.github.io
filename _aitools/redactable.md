Redactable is a cloud-based redaction tool that enables organizations to securely and efficiently remove sensitive information from PDF documents. Powered by AI, Redactable automates the redaction process, providing significant time savings and stronger data protection compared to traditional manual approaches.

Tailored for businesses, legal firms, government agencies, and any organization managing confidential documents, Redactable tackles the challenges of conventional redaction methods. It eliminates the risk of incomplete redaction often seen with manual tools like markers or basic PDF editors, which can leave sensitive information exposed.

Redactable solves two key issues frequently overlooked in manual redaction. First, it addresses the problem of incomplete data removal caused by placing black boxes over text, which fails to delete the underlying content. Second, it ensures comprehensive metadata removal, which is often missed by typical PDF editing software. Redactable ensures both visible content and hidden metadata are thoroughly redacted, offering a complete document security solution.

Key features of Redactable include:

* AI-powered automation for fast, accurate identification of sensitive information 
* Permanent redaction that fully removes data, unlike surface-level overlays 
* OCR technology for redacting scanned and image-based PDFs 
* Metadata removal to prevent unintentional data exposure 
* Integration with cloud services like Box and OneDrive for easy workflow management
