description: "OpenAI Codex is an artificial intelligence model developed by OpenAI. It parses natural language and
generates code in response. It is used to power GitHub Copilot, a programming autocompletion tool developed for select
IDEs, like Visual Studio Code and Neovim. OpenAI Codex is a general-purpose programming model, meaning that it can be
applied to essentially any programming task (though results may vary). It has been used for transpilation, explaining
code, and refactoring code. It is a natural language-to-code system based on GPT-3, which helps turn simple English
instructions into over a dozen popular coding languages"
