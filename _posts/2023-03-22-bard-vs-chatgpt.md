# Introduction

Google introduced [Bard](https://blog.google/technology/ai/try-bard/), an AI (artificial intelligence) chatbot that can
interact with human beings in the form of chat conversations. ChatGPT was introduced by OpenAI which interacts in a
conversational way. The dialogue format makes it possible for ChatGPT to answer followup questions, admit its mistakes,
challenge incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests. At a high level Bard is a chatbot built on top of LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications), a conversational AI model capable of fluid, multi-turn dialogue, 
whereas ChatGPT is built on top of Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT-3) as its underlying technology. In this tutorial 
we will dive into some of the differences between Google Bard AI vs ChatGPT in various aspects. 

Let's get started. 

## Google Bard AI vs ChatGPT Comparison
Here is the comparison across various properties for each of these languages.

## 1. Real time information 
#### Bard

Bard AI has a unique advantage over ChatGPT in this case as it can access real-time information from Google. With this
capability, Bard can provide accurate and relevant answers to users' questions based on the latest available data.
You can give Bard a latest url in 2023 and ask for summary of it. Here is an example. 


#### ChatGPT

Compared to Bard, ChatGPT has a limitation in that its training data is cut off at September 2021. This means that it
may not be able to provide accurate or current information for questions related to recent events or trends. As a
result, we might need to seek out other sources for up-to-date information.

## 2. Context retention
Holding context refers to the ability to remember information that has been previously discussed in a conversation. This
is important for language models because it allows them to respond more naturally and to understand the full meaning of
what is being said.

#### Bard

Bard's ability to hold context is purposefully limited for now because it is still under development. As Bard learns
more about the world and how to communicate with humans, its ability to hold context will improve. This will allow Bard
to have longer, more meaningful conversations with humans. 

When you open bard.google.com you end up with a fresh screen with fresh context. There is no option to continue
conversation from where you left. 

#### ChatGPT 

ChatGPT is able to remember what was said in previous conversations. In ChatGPT UI, you can start a "New Chat" for every
conversation. Each chat tab has its own context and ChatGPT can continue the conversation from where its left for each
chat tab. Only caveat is that it can only remember up to 3,000 words (anything beyond that isn’t stored), and it doesn’t
use past conversation to form responses.

## 3. Input and Output Limits:

#### Bard

The exact limits of how many tokens of text Bard can give in input and output are not publicly available, but it is
likely to be in the range of 100,000 to 1,000,000 tokens. Some users reported Bard has an input limit of around 4,000
letters or approximately 1,000 tokens. The output limit is still being tested, but it's clear that there are constraints
on the length of its responses.

#### ChatGPT

ChatGPT on the other hand has around 16,000 characters, approximately, ~4,000 tokens. This enables it to handle longer
inputs and generate more extensive outputs. If response goes beyond this limit it gets cut abruptly. 

## 4. Performance

#### Bard
For complex queries, Bard still lacks lot of training and development. Its good for general purpose use cases. But for 
complex cases such as programming etc need more development. 

#### ChatGPT 
ChatGPT has an edge in this context for complex tasks. It can give decent responses for coding questions and complex 
comprehensive questions. 

## 5. Language support
#### Bard

Bard is currently able to translate text into a limited number of languages i.e. English. It is still
under development and improving its ability to translate into other languages. 

#### ChatGPT
ChatGPT on the other hand has some multilingual capabilities including spanish, fresh etc. But it also has limitations in language
support. However, it outperforms Bard in the aforementioned languages.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, both Google Bard and ChatGPT are AI chatbots designed to interact with humans in a conversational manner.
Bard is built on top of LaMDA, while ChatGPT is built on top of GPT-3.5-turbo. While both chatbots have their
similarities, they also have their differences in terms of the technology behind them, their capabilities, and their
limitations. Ultimately, the choice between the two chatbots will depend on the specific needs and preferences of the
user. Regardless of the chatbot chosen, it is evident that AI chatbots are becoming increasingly sophisticated and are
revolutionizing the way we interact with technology.
