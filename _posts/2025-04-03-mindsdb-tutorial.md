## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the tutorial, you need to ensure that certain prerequisites are met. These include:

- Python 3.6 or higher and pip installed on your system.
- One of the following SQL databases:

   - MySQL
   - PostgreSQL
   - SQLite

- Basic knowledge of Python and SQL.

If you have not installed Python and pip on your system, you can download them from the official website. To download the SQL database, you can refer to their respective documentations.

## Installing MindsDB

MindsDB is an open-source tool that can be installed on your machine using pip. The first step is to open a command prompt and enter the following command:

```python
pip install mindsdb
```

This will install the latest stable release of MindsDB on your system. After installation is complete, you can import MindsDB into your Python script to get started:

```python
from mindsdb import *
```

## Importing and initializing MindsDB

To work with MindsDB, you need to initialize it in your Python script. You can use the `MindsDB()` constructor to create a MindsDB object:

```python
mdb = MindsDB()
```

## Connecting to your SQL database

After initializing MindsDB, you need to connect it to your SQL database. MindsDB provides the `mindsdb_native_sql` utility function for this purpose.

To connect to your database, you need to specify the database connection parameters. These parameters are passed as a dictionary to the `connection_config` parameter of the `mindsdb_native_sql` function:

```python
connection_config = {
    'sql': {
            'host': '<YOUR_DATABASE_HOST>',
            'username': '<YOUR_DATABASE_USERNAME>',
            'password': '<YOUR_DATABASE_PASSWORD>',
            'port': '<YOUR_DATABASE_PORT>',
            'database': '<YOUR_DATABASE_NAME>'
        }
}

mdb = mindsdb_native_sql(connection_config=connection_config)
```

Make sure to replace the database connection parameters with the correct values according to your own SQL database setup.

## Preparing your data

After connecting MindsDB to your SQL database, you need to prepare your data. You can use SQL queries to filter and select the data you want to train your model on. For example:

```python
query = 'SELECT model, year, mileage, price FROM cars'

mdb.learn(
    from_data=query,
    to_predict='price'
)
```

In the above code snippet, we are selecting the `model`, `year`, `mileage`, and `price` columns from the `cars` table. We are then passing the `query` variable to the `from_data` parameter of the `learn()` function to specify our training data. The `to_predict` parameter is used to specify the column we want to predict i.e. `price`.

## Making predictions

After preparing your data, you can make predictions using MindsDB. To make a prediction, you need to create a dictionary object that contains the input data you want to predict. For example:

```python
predict_data = {'model': 'toyota', 'year': 2004, 'mileage': 63000}
```

In the above code snippet, we are creating a dictionary object `predict_data` that contains the values for `model`, `year`, and `mileage`. We can then use MindsDB's `predict()` method to make predictions for this data:

```python
result = mdb.predict(predict_data)
```

The `predict()` function returns a list of dictionaries where each dictionary contains the predicted values for the input data. In this case, the predicted `price` of the car based on the values for `model`, `year`, and `mileage`.

## Viewing the Results

After making predictions, you can view the results in Python. For example:

```python
print(result[0]['price'])
```

The above code snippet prints the predicted `price` of the car based on the input data.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have covered the steps necessary to build a predictive model using MindsDB with a SQL database. We
have walked through connecting MindsDB to your SQL database, preparing your data, making predictions, and retrieving the
results. MindsDB is a powerful tool that makes it easy to build predictive models without requiring advanced knowledge
of machine learning. We hope this tutorial has provided you with a good introduction to using MindsDB with SQL
databases.
