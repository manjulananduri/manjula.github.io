## How to create midjourney prompts for architecture
Every text to image AI Art tool requires some kind of fine tuning for stunning image outputs. 
To create innovative architectures, you can structure the prompt in the following way. 

> ***Generate a [2D/3D] [architectural element] inspired by [architect name] with [architectural style] [description of the architectural element], incorporating [additional design elements].***

Note that text inside square brackets are variables. These are optional fields and feel free to playaround them.

##### [2D/3D]
This refers to the dimension of the architectural representation. You can choose whether you want the AI to generate a two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) depiction of the architectural element.

Example: Generate a 3D skyscraper...

##### [architectural element]
Replace this with the specific architectural element you want the AI to create. It could be a building type, structure, feature, or any other architectural component.

Example: skyscraper, underwater scene etc.

##### [architect name]
Insert the name of a renowned architect whose style or work you want to draw inspiration from.

Example: ...inspired by Norman Foster...

##### [architectural style]
Specify the architectural style that you want the generated element to reflect, which could be associated with the architect's work or a particular design philosophy.

Example: ...with a futuristic design.

##### [description of the architectural element]
Provide a vivid description of the architectural element you want to be generated. This should include the visual aspects and key features that you envision.

Example: Picture a towering glass and steel skyscraper reaching for the sky, incorporating advanced energy-efficient technologies and dynamic facade elements.

##### [additional design elements]
Include any other design elements, characteristics, or features that you want to be incorporated into the generated architectural element. These can enhance the uniqueness and creativity of the AI-generated art.

Example: The architecture should capture Foster's signature blend of innovation and aesthetic elegance.


Putting it all together, here's are some good example prompts that can be created. 


#### Example 1: 
Generate a 3D skyscraper inspired by Norman Foster with a futuristic design.
Picture a towering glass and steel skyscraper reaching for the sky, incorporating advanced energy-efficient technologies and dynamic facade elements. The architecture should capture Foster's signature blend of innovation and aesthetic elegance.

<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/architecture_1.png" alt="Midjourney prompts for architecture">

#### Example 2: 
Design a 2D courtyard inspired by Luis Barragán with his iconic use of color.
Picture a serene courtyard characterized by vibrant pink walls, complemented by lush greenery and water features. The architecture should incorporate Barragán's mastery of light and shadow to create a visually captivating and emotionally resonant space.

<img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/architecture_2_1.png" alt="Midjourney prompts for architecture">


#### Example 3: 
Generate a 3D bridge inspired by Santiago Calatrava with his kinetic approach.
Picture an elegant bridge that mimics the motion of wings in flight, incorporating moving parts that respond to wind currents. The architecture should embody Calatrava's ability to create structures that merge engineering precision with artistic expression.
