## How to create stunning midjourney prompts for t-shirt design

#### 1. Incorporate Relevant Keywords
To get the most accurate and inspiring prompts for t-shirt design, be sure to include essential keywords. Variations like "t-shirt design," "t shirt design," or "tshirt design" are vital to ensure that the prompts generated are focused on your specific creative project. These keywords guide Midjourney in delivering prompts that align with your t-shirt design goals.

#### 2. Utilize Aspect Ratio Parameters
Midjourney prompts allow you to specify the aspect ratio of the design you're looking for. To get vertical height designs suitable for t-shirts, you can use the "--ar 2:3" parameter. This ensures that the design will fit and look great on the front or back of a t-shirt.

#### 3. Customize the Preview 
Midjourney provides various parameters to tailor the preview to your needs. If you prefer not to have a preview of the t-shirt on a person, you can use negative parameters such as "--no body" or "--no person." This is particularly useful if you want a clear and unobstructed view of the design itself.

#### 4. Ideal for Generating Prints on Demand
When you request t-shirt design prompts from Midjourney, you'll receive plain images without the actual t-shirt illustration. This feature is especially advantageous for those utilizing print-on-demand tools for their merchandise.

Print-on-demand services often require designs to be provided in a way that separates the design from the physical t-shirt shape. Midjourney's output aligns perfectly with this requirement. It means you can focus on the creative aspect of the design without being constrained by the physical representation of the t-shirt. This flexibility makes Midjourney prompts an ideal choice for those looking to create prints for a variety of merchandise, from t-shirts to posters, without worrying about the specific garment shape.
