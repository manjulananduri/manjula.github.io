In the previous article we learnt about [50+ Chatgpt prompts for Midjourney - Generative AI art](/chatgpt-prompts-for-midjourney/). In this blog post we will look at effective ChatGPT prompts for resume writing and job search. 

When you're on the hunt for a new job, your resume is often the first impression that potential employers will have of
you. It's essential to make sure your resume showcases your skills, experience, and achievements in a way that stands
out from the crowd. But how do you know where to start, or what to include on your resume? That's where ChatGPT comes
in.

ChatGPT is an AI language model trained by OpenAI that can generate natural language responses to your prompts. By
asking ChatGPT for help with your resume, you can get personalized and actionable suggestions that will help you land
your dream job. In addition to ChatGPT, Google recently announced they will soon release Bard AI as an experimental
chatbot similar to ChatGPT. Since both these chatbots work in similar way, you can use these prompts in either of these 
tools. 

In this post, we'll share more than 50 ChatGPT prompts that you can use for resume writing and job
search.

Let's get started. 

The best way to utilize ChatGPT for resume and job search is by being very specific for each of the sections of the
resume. If you look at a typical resume, different sections that we include are

1. Header: Includes your name, contact information, and professional title
2. Summary/Objective: A brief statement that highlights your career goals and qualifications
3. Education: Lists your academic credentials, such as degrees and certifications
4. Work Experience: Details your work history, including job titles, companies, dates of employment, and job duties and
   accomplishments
5. Skills: A list of your relevant skills, such as technical skills, language proficiency, or soft skills
6. Awards/Achievements: Highlights any accolades or recognition you have received for your work
7. References: Optional section that lists professional references who can vouch for your qualifications and work ethic.

Note that some of these sections may be more or less important depending on the individual's career level, industry, and
job goals.

Now we can ask ChatGPT / Bard to generate a general prompt to generate the resume or we can go in depth by asking
ChatGPT to generate ideas for each of the individual sections. Let's begin with simplest method first.

## Simple Chatgpt or Bard AI prompt for resume

Simplest and fastest prompt you can ask ChatGPT or Bard to generate your resume with decent result is
