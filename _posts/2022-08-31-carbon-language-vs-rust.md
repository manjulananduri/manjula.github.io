Google introduced Carbon language as the next generation programming language with a goal to replace C++ as a successor. It's an open source project still in experimental phase. Originally demonstrated by Chandler Carruth in [CppNorth](https://cppnorth.ca/) conference, Carbon language looks like a great alternative to C++.

In this tutorial we will learn about various aspects of Carbon language and jump into carbon language basic syntax along with examples code that you can use to try the language after reading through the end of this documentation.

Let's dive in.

## What and Why Carbon Language ?

Carbon language can replace C++ as things evolve. C++ is already a great language to work with. It can give high performance and widely used in many production systems. It can run with multiple platforms, hardware architecture and many operating systems. However some of the problems with C++ are

- Accumulated technical debt (eg: Integer promotion rules) across various functionalities. Backward compatibility with C makes it even more hard to fix tech debt and make code changes hard to implement.
- Evolution process to add new functionalities to C++ is very difficult as it needs to adhere to ISO process overhead, preventing from experimentation etc.

So C++ is falling short of some of it's goals like Performance critical software; Software and language evolution; Code that is easy to understand and write; Fast and scalable development and so on.

Since solving these problems with C++ is really hard, after a deep research and evaluation across multiple languages by Google engineers, **Carbon programming language** is introduced. So it is like a successor to C++ similar to

- C -> C++
- JavaScript -> TypeScript
- Objective-C -> Swift
- Java -> Kotlin
- C++ -> Carbon Language

where the left part of arrow is the original language and right part is the replacing language.

Some of the key aspects of successor languages include - Building on top of existing ecosystem, Bi-directional interoperability, Optimize learning curve , Modern tooling systems like package manager etc.

Carbon language is not inherited from legacy C or C++. It's built from scratch with modern  language fundamentals such as Generics, Modular code, Consistent, Simple syntax.

## Conclusion:
Hope this tutorial helps you to play around and understand the basic concepts, syntax examples with google carbon language . While this is not the full list of supported syntax, while we experiment more with features of Carbon, we will cover it as part of the future articles. For any kind of questions or comments drop a note below.

What's next?

- A real world project built on top of supported Carbon language features.
- We will cover Carbon language updates very closely with a free newsletter and detailed articles. If you are interested in learning more about Carbon, drop your email to our Newsletter to stay on top of Carbon and latest improvements.
