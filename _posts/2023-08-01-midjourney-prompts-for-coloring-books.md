## Tips to generate good coloring book pages 

Designing coloring book images using AI art generators like midjourney can be a creative and exciting process. Here are some best tips
to help you create stunning coloring book illustrations using AI:

1. **Keyword "Coloring Book":** Make sure to include the keyword "coloring book" in the AI prompt to ensure the
      generated images align with the coloring book theme.

2. **Focus on Outlines:** Emphasize the importance of clean and well-defined outlines in coloring book illustrations.
   Instruct the AI to only draw outlines and avoid filling in colors or shades.

3. **Eliminate Noise and Distractions:** Instruct the AI to avoid adding noise or unnecessary elements to the
   illustrations. Keep the focus on the main subject to ensure a clean and uncluttered coloring experience.

4. **Ensure Thick Outlines:** Thick outlines make coloring book images stand out and provide ample space for coloring.
   Specify thicker line settings to midjourney for this effect.

5. **Encourage Storybook Illustrations:** If your coloring book has a specific theme or storyline, guide the AI to
   create illustrations that fit into that narrative. Storybook-style illustrations can captivate colorists and provide
   a sense of storytelling.

6. **Grayscale Reference:** If possible, provide grayscale reference images or samples to the AI. This can help guide
   the AI's understanding of the desired style and composition.

7. **Test Multiple Prompts:** Experiment with different AI prompts to explore various styles and themes for your
   coloring book. This allows for a diverse range of illustrations that cater to different preferences.

8. **Opt for 1-Bit Line Art:** To maintain a classic coloring book style, consider using 1-bit line art, where each line
   is either black or white. This style is reminiscent of traditional coloring books and allows for easy coloring with
   markers or pencils.

By following these tips, you can create a collection of beautifully detailed coloring book illustrations using
midjourney. Encourage colorists to embrace their creativity and imagination while adding vibrant colors to bring these
illustrations to life. Happy designing!
