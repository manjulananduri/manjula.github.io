# Introduction to Midjourney prompts for characters 

Midjourney is an AI art generation tool that allows users to generate unique, high-quality images using text prompts. It
uses cutting-edge AI algorithms to generate images that are unlike anything else on the web. Recently, Midjourney
launched a new feature called `/describe` that allows users to upload an image and get text prompts that try to describe
the image. In this blog post, we will dive into how the `/describe` command works and explore the ways in which it can be
used to create compelling AI-generated art. In this tutorial we will learn about how to use `/describe` command in midjourney 
to get prompts for the images. 

> Prompt to image and image to prompt are both possible with midjourney now.

## Midjourney describe command

Until now, midjourney can create images from prompts using natural language or keywords. The /describe command is a new
feature on Midjourney that allows users to upload an image and get four text prompts that try to describe the image. The
output of the describe command is a set of text prompts that describe the image approximately. These prompts can then be
used to generate images that are related to the original image, but with unique twists and variations. The /describe
command is a powerful tool that can be used to generate a wide range of AI-generated art, from abstract pieces to
realistic depictions of objects and scenes.

## How does the describe command work in midjourney 

To use the /describe command, users simply need to type /describe followed by an image upload. Midjourney will then
generate four text prompts that try to describe the image. These prompts are designed to be open-ended and allow for a
wide range of interpretations. Some examples of prompts generated by the /describe command might include. 

Here is a step by step process: 

### Step 1: Enter /describe in discord chat: 
Once you are inside the discord chat, enter `/describe` command and press Enter
Here is a sample output image: 

<img src="/assets/images/midjourney-describe-input.png" class="img-fluid" alt="midjourney describe command input">

### Step 2: Upload image 

Now upload the image that you want to describe by either drag and drop the image on to the window or by clicking on the image upload box. 
Here is how upload image looks like: 

<img src="/assets/images/midjourney-describe-image-upload.png" class="img-fluid" alt="midjourney describe command image upload">

Once you upload the image press Enter or Send the message. 

### Step 3: Progress & output 
Once the prompt is entered, image will be uploaded on to discord and sent to midjourney. 
Midjourney then takes sometime to process the image. When the image process happens the output looks like below: 

<img src="/assets/images/midjourney-describe-progress.png" class="img-fluid" alt="midjourney describe command output">

Once the reponse is received from midjourney, you can see the output as shown below. 
As part of the output you will receive 4 different prompts that closely describes what is given in the input image. 

<img src="/assets/images/midjourney-describe-output.png" class="img-fluid" alt="midjourney describe command output">

For the example image uploaded, the ouput received is: 

1. an artistic illustration of mountains and cloud with a lake and waterfall, in the style of intricate psychedelic
   landscapes, spherical sculptures, dark cyan and maroon, martin ansin, colorful, eye-catching compositions, victor
   moscoso, light cyan and amber

2. an artwork of a waterfall in some mountains, in the style of psychedelic graphic design, spherical sculptures, dark
   crimson and aquamarine, colorful landscapes, detailed illustrations, vibrant color fields, lightbox

3. an image of an ocean and mountainside with a mountain, in the style of psychedelic illustration, spherical
   sculptures, realistic color palette, detailed illustrations, dark cyan and maroon, illustration, landscapist

4. the landscape in the mountains has colorful mountain scenery, in the style of tristan eaton, psychedelic
   illustration, spherical sculptures, dark cyan and amber, illustration, luminosity of water, fine and detailed


### Step 4: Generate variations: 
Since you have prompt that is close enough to the original image, you can now generate your own variations of this image. 

To do that click on one of the buttons present below the output images in step 3 (i.e. 1,2,3,4 buttons). 

When you click send or enter, you might receive a warning that the prompt is being sent to midjourney. You can just press submit and the prompt will be sent to the serer. 

<img src="/assets/images/midjourney-describe-warning.png" class="img-fluid" alt="midjourney describe command output variation">

This prompt is sent just like the regular `/imagine` prompt. 
After sometime you should 4 different variations of the prompt that you sent. Here is the output that is received after giving the prompt. 

As you can see this output is close enough to the input image that we originally gave. 

<img src="/assets/images/midjourney-output-variation.png" class="img-fluid" alt="midjourney describe command output variation">

Note that these images are created using Midjourney's advanced AI algorithms and can be highly varied, even
when using the same prompt. Users can experiment with different combinations of prompts and images to create unique
pieces of AI-generated art that are unlike anything else on the web.


## How can the /describe command be used?
The /describe command is a versatile tool that can be used in a wide range of creative contexts. Some possible use cases for the /describe command might include:

### Creative Inspiration
One of the most obvious uses of the /describe command is as a source of creative inspiration. By uploading an image and generating text prompts that describe it, users can gain new insights into the image and explore new ways of representing it. The open-ended nature of the prompts means that there are countless possibilities for interpretation, which can lead to unexpected and exciting results.

### Content Creation
Another use case for the /describe command is as a tool for content creation. By using the prompts generated by the /describe command as a starting point, users can quickly and easily generate a wide range of images that are related to their original image. These images can be used as standalone pieces of art, or as part of larger creative projects such as graphic design or video production.

### Learning and Exploration
Finally, the /describe command can be used as a tool for learning and exploration. By experimenting with different combinations of prompts and images, users can gain a deeper understanding of how Midjourney's AI algorithms work and how they can be used to generate unique and compelling art. This can be especially valuable for artists, designers, and other creative professionals who are interested in exploring new ways of working with AI-generated art.

## Conclusion

The /describe command is a powerful new feature on Midjourney that allows users to upload an image and generate four
text prompts that try to describe it. These prompts can then be used to generate unique and compelling AI-generated art
that is unlike anything else on the web. Whether used for creative inspiration, content creation, or learning and
