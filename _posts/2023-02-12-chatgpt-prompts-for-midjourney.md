## How to make chatgpt to generate prompts for midjourney ? 
Mid-Journey is an innovative app that utilizes artificial intelligence to generate art from simple prompts. With its user-friendly interface and powerful algorithms, it offers a unique and exciting way to create art and explore new concepts. To make the most of this app, it's important to have high-quality prompts that inspire and guide the AI to generate the best results. 

ChatGPT is a state-of-the-art language model developed by OpenAI, capable of generating human-like text in response to a prompt. By using ChatGPT to generate prompts for Mid-Journey, you can create customized, actionable prompts that will help you get the most out of the app.

In order to generate chatgpt prompts for midjourney we can follow few simple steps. 

### Step 1: Setup ChatGPT for midjourney context
While ChatGPT is a smart AI assistant, it's knowledge is limited to training data until 2021 at the time of writing this article. 
The key ingredient to make ChatGPT give creative prompts for midjourney is to properly set context for ChatGPT to understand what is MidJourney. 
To do that we will use the following prompt 

> Pretend you are a graphic designer generating creative images for midjourney. Midjourney is an app that can generate AI art from simple prompts. I will give you a concept and you will give me 5 different prompts that I can feed into midjourney. Make sure they are creative . 

The moment you specify above prompt for midjourney, we will get a result with a random concept. 

```
Sample response: 

Great! Here are five prompts for generating AI art on Midjourney based on the concept of "Underwater World":

A coral reef teeming with vibrant, exotic fish.
An underwater city with towering buildings and bustling traffic.
A giant octopus surrounded by a cloud of ink, lurking in the depths.
A mermaid lounging on a rock, surrounded by glittering schools of fish.
A deep-sea diver encountering a massive, majestic whale.
```

Note that every New Chat in ChatGPT creates context for that specific conversation. So if when asking about prompt, try in a new chat so that you can reuse that Chat window for prompts in next steps. 

### Step 2: Decide your Concept

The second step in using ChatGPT to generate prompts for Mid-Journey is to choose a concept or theme that you want to explore. This could be anything from a specific style of art to a particular subject matter. Consider what you want to create and what you hope to achieve with your AI-generated art. If you not sure what concept to chose, ask ChatGPT to 
> Give me a list of 5 creative concepts that I can use to generate AI art

Here is a sample response from ChatGPT: 

```
Sure, here is a list of 5 creative concepts that you can use to generate AI art
1. A dreamscape of a futuristic city
2. An abstract landscape inspired by nature
3. A surreal portrait of an animal
4. A macro shot of a beautifully textured flower
5. A stylized depiction of a city skyline at night

```

### Step 3: Provide a Starting concept Prompt

Once you've chosen your concept, it's time to provide ChatGPT with a starting prompt. This could be as simple as "A peacock and a parrot"  or "A car and a bike" etc.  You can also specify this simply by skipping step 1 and step 2 with a prompt like "create a generative AI art prompt for a beautiful butterfly in forest" or "generate a prompt for a futuristic cityscape for generative AI art". The starting prompt should be clear and concise, providing ChatGPT with enough information to generate relevant prompts.

```
Prompt: A peacock and a parrot

Response:

Certainly! Here are five creative prompts for generating AI art on Midjourney based on the concept of "Peacock and Parrot":

A flamboyant parade of peacocks and parrots, each more colorful and extravagant than the last.
A majestic peacock with iridescent feathers perched on a branch, while a brilliant parrot swoops by in the background.
A mystical garden filled with peacock and parrot topiaries, each crafted from intricate foliage and floral patterns.
A fantastical jungle where peacocks and parrots reign supreme, their feathers and wings bursting with enchanting patterns and designs.
A playful scene where a curious parrot perches on the head of a majestic peacock, each adorned with elaborate, complementary plumage.
```

### Step 4: Request different variations

After providing your starting prompt, ask ChatGPT to generate different variations for the same concept. This will give you a variety of options to choose from, allowing you to select the one that best fits your needs. You can ask ChatGPT to provide the variations by entering 

> Can you generate 3 different variations of your previous response ? 

Quick tip: ChatGPT can become too creative at this point. So ask ChatGPT to customize it as per your interests just like you make your specifications to a graphic designer. 

### Step 5: Copy and Paste the Prompts into Mid-Journey

Once you've selected the prompt you want to use, simply copy and paste it into the Mid-Journey discord app with the tag `/imagine`. The app will then use the prompt to generate AI-generated art based on your specifications.
Eg: `/imagine a butterfly with a beautiful wings on a unicorn`

### Step 6: Experiment and Refine

Finally, experiment with different prompts and see what kind of results you get. You may want to try using different concepts or adjusting your prompts to see how they affect the AI-generated art. With time and experimentation, you'll be able to fine-tune your prompts and get the most out of the Mid-Journey app.

Similar steps can be followed for generating prompts for stable diffusion, DALL-E-2 etc. 

In conclusion, using ChatGPT to generate prompts for Mid-Journey can help you get the most out of the app and create unique, high-quality AI-generated art. Give it a try and see what kind of results you can achieve!
