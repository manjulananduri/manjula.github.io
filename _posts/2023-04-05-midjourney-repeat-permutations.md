# Introduction 

In the previous blog post, we explored [50+ best midjourney prompts](/midjourney-prompts-for-realism/) for creating
photo realistic images. In this blog post we will look at midjourney new features: repeat and permutations.

Midjourney is an AI art generation tool that creates images using natural language descriptions. It gained massive
popularity among artists, designers, and writers who are interested in exploring the boundaries between language and
visual art.

Today, Midjourney announced two new advanced prompting features that promise to increase the pace of exploration for its
users. These features generate tons of jobs and can use tons of GPUs, so they're limited right now to Pro Members (the
$60/mo plan) and fast-hours only.

Let's take a closer look at these new features.

## Midjourney repeat feature

The Repeat feature allows users to run a single job multiple times with different variations. To use this feature,
simply type --repeat followed by the number of times you want to run the job.

For example, let's say you want to generate five different 2x2 grids of cats. You could type /imagine cats --repeat 5
and Midjourney will generate five different images of cats in a 2x2 grid.

But what if you want to take things even further? You can mix the Repeat feature with other arguments like --chaos to
radically increase your pace of exploration. For example, you could type /imagine cats --repeat 5 --chaos 5 to generate
five 2x2 grids of cats with different levels of randomness and chaos.

The Repeat feature is a powerful tool that allows you to quickly explore different variations of a single idea. It's
perfect for artists and designers who want to iterate quickly and experiment with different possibilities.

### Repeat Feature Examples
* /imagine a red rose --repeat 10: This command will generate 10 different images of a red rose.
* /imagine a forest --chaos --repeat 3: This command will generate 3 different chaotic images of a forest.
* /imagine a rainbow --repeat 4 --chaos --blend 0.7: This command will generate 4 images of a rainbow with a 
high level of chaos and a blend of 0.7

## Midjourney Permutations Feature

The Permutations feature is even more powerful one. It allows users to create large numbers of jobs
with different combinations of words. To use this feature, simply list the words you want to combine inside curly braces
{} and separate them with commas.

For example, let's say you want to generate images of different cyberpunk, vaporwave, and art deco animals. You could
type /imagine a {cyberpunk, vaporwave, art deco} {cat, dog} and Midjourney will generate six (3 * 2 = 6) different images:

* /imagine a cyberpunk cat
* /imagine a vaporwave cat
* /imagine a art deco cat
* /imagine a cyberpunk dog
* /imagine a vaporwave dog
* /imagine a art deco dog

You can even nest curly braces inside other curly braces but be careful around the usage of it. For example, you could
type /imagine A {sculpture, painting} of a {seagull {on a pier, on a beach}, poodle {on a sofa, in a truck}} and
Midjourney will generate eight different images:

* /imagine A sculpture of a seagull on a pier
* /imagine A sculpture of a seagull on a beach
* /imagine A sculpture of a poodle on a sofa
* /imagine A sculpture of a poodle in a truck
* /imagine A painting of a seagull on a pier
* /imagine A painting of a seagull on a beach
* /imagine A painting of a poodle on a sofa
* /imagine A painting of a poodle in a truck

### Permutations Feature Examples:

* /imagine a {dark, bright} {city, town, village} at {night, dawn, sunset}: This command will generate 18 different images
with various combinations of darkness and time of day. 

* /imagine a {blue, green, yellow, red} {bird, butterfly,
dragonfly}: This command will generate 12 different images with different combinations of colors and creatures. 

* /imagine
a {rustic, modern} {kitchen, bathroom} with a {wooden, marble} countertop: This command will generate 4 different images
with different styles of kitchens or bathrooms and countertops.

The Permutations feature is a game-changer for artists and designers who want to quickly generate a large number of
images with different variations. It's perfect for creating series or collections of images with a common theme.


These examples demonstrate how the Repeat and Permutations features can be used to quickly generate a large number of
images with varying parameters. With the Repeat feature, users can generate multiple copies of the same image with just
one command, while the Permutations feature allows users to create many unique images with different combinations of
words.
