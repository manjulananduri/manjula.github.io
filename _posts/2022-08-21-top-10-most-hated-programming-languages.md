In the previous post we learnt about the [top 10 most loved programming languages of 2022](/top-10-most-loved-programming-languages-2022/) and which companies use them. 

Working with programming languages is always fun. Every language is designed for a specific purpose and things can evolve differently as technology makes progress.

Quick disclaimer: Each language has its own advantages and disadvantages and everyone of us has our favourites and not so favourites. This post is purely for educational purposes and not meant to demote or promote any specific language. 

Stackoverflow conducted a developer survey in 2022 in various categories of technology, programming languages, professional tools, cloud providers etc. This survey is the primary source of data for this article. 

In this post, we will look at top 10 most hated programming languages of 2022 and what they are used for, based on 71,467 responses received from [StackOverflow survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/).

To have a neutral tone, we will use **dreaded** (instead of hated) as we go through the post. 

**Alright! let's get started! Here is the top 10 most dreaded programming language list**

## 1. [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/discovery/what-is-matlab.html)
MATLABÂ® is a programming language designed for engineers and scientists for analysis, visualization, computation in environments where mathematical expressions are predominant in solving problems and solutions.
It's a matrix-based language that allows most natural expression of computational mathematics.

As per matlab official [site](https://www.mathworks.com/discovery/what-is-matlab.html),
> Millions of engineers and scientists worldwide use MATLAB for a range of applications, in industry and academia, including deep learning and machine learning, signal processing and communications, 
image and video processing, control systems, test and measurement, computational finance, and computational biology.

80.84% voted MATLAB as dreaded language. 

#### Popular companies using MATLAB

- AMD 
- Volvo Cars
