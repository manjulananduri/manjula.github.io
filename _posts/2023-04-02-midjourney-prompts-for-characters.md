## How to generate midjourney prompts for photo realism

1. Use the latest AI model, Midjourney v5, to create photorealistic images. For example, create a portrait of a person
   that looks like a photograph, with realistic skin tones and sharp details -- v5 
2. Use a long lens, such as an 85mm, 100mm or 200mm, to isolate portrait subjects and create a shallow depth of field.
   For example, create a portrait of a person with a blurred background, making the subject stand out and appear more
   prominent with 100mm lens.
3. Use specific camera models, such as the Sony α7 III, Nikon D850 DSLR 4k or Canon EOS R5, or even the Hasselblad, to
   create high-quality images with realistic colors and details. For example, create a portrait of a person with a Sony
   α7 III camera, capturing their features and expressions with precision.
4. Use keywords such as "candid" "personal", 4k, 8k to recreate a natural and authentic look in high quality. For
   example, create an image of a person laughing with their friends in candid 8k form, capturing a genuine moment of joy
   and happiness.
5. Use a wide aperture setting, such as F 1.2, to create a blurry background and make the subject stand out. For
   example, create a portrait of a person with a blurred background of a cornfield, giving the image a dreamy and
   romantic feel.
6. Add blurry backdrop hints, such as an abandoned church or a street photo at night, to create a sense of mood and
   atmosphere. For example, create a portrait of a person with a blurred background of a city street at night, creating
   a sense of mystery and intrigue.
7. Use dreamlike lighting or dramatic lighting to create a sense of depth and contrast in the image. For example, create
   a portrait of a person with dramatic lighting, casting strong shadows and highlights on their face.
8. Create ultra-detailed images with sharp lines and textures, capturing every detail with precision. For example,
   create a portrait of a person with a detailed texture of their skin, making the image appear more realistic.
9. Create personal portraits that capture the essence of the person's character and personality. For example, create a
   portrait of a person in their natural environment, showcasing their interests and passions.
10. Use the "--testp" command to put Midjourney into photorealism mode, creating images that look like real photographs.
11. Use an aspect ratio of 9:16, which is commonly used for portrait images on social media platforms like Instagram and
    TikTok.
12. Experiment with Vermeer lighting or Rembrandt lighting, two famous oil paint artists who used atmospheric light for
    creative advantage. For example, create a portrait of a person with Vermeer lighting, creating a soft and warm glow
    that illuminates their face.
