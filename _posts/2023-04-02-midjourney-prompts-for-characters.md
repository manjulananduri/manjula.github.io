## Midjourney tips for creative character prompts 
Here are some of the practical tips to get best results out of midjourney prompts that involve characters, personas, 
movie actors or artists. 

### 1. For creating animated midjourney characters, use the --niji mode.
* The Niji Journey and Niji Mode both pertain to the same generator, however, they are accessed differently.
* Midjourney users have the option to switch to Niji Mode by appending “--niji” to their prompt when messaging the
   midjourney bot.
* On the other hand, the Niji Journey is a Discord server with its own bot, the Niji Journey Bot, that can also
   generate outputs similar to Midjourney. Users can communicate with the Niji Journey Bot by using the same
   “--niji” command and prompt as they would with Midjourney.

### 2. Take advantage of midjourney v5 to describe characters   

Midjourney v5 is great for natural language. In previous versions of midjourney (i.e. v4 and older) to get better output
we need to stuff the prompt with keywords. But in v5 we can just describe in conversational english tone. So describe
characters as much as possible for best outputs.

### 3. Introduce new characters or environments

Mid-journey prompts can be a great way to introduce new characters or settings that challenge the character's
perspective. Think about how these new elements can change the character's trajectory and create prompts that explore
these changes.
* Example: Your character has been traveling alone for a while, but they stumble upon a small village in the middle of
   the forest. As they explore, they meet a group of people who are very different from anyone they've met before.
   Choose one of these new characters and write a scene where they challenge your main character's beliefs or values.


### 4. Consider the character's backstory 
Think about the character's past experiences and how they may have shaped who they are. Use this information to create
prompts that challenge the character's beliefs and force them to confront their inner demons.
Example: Write a scene where the character visits a place from their childhood that holds happy memories. As they
revisit this place, they reflect on how far they have come since those days and how much they have grown as a person.
Use this moment of reflection to show how the character's past experiences have shaped them into a stronger, more
resilient individual.

### 5. Think about the character's goals
What does the character want? What are their motivations? Create prompts that test the character's resolve and push them
to go beyond their comfort zone.

### 6. Create moral dilemmas
A great way to challenge your character is to create moral dilemmas that force them to make tough decisions. Think about
what values are important to your character and create prompts that put those values to the test.

### 7. Consider the character's relationships
Relationships can be a powerful tool for character development. Create prompts that explore the character's
relationships with other characters and how those relationships evolve over time.

### 8. Use the environment to your advantage
Use the environment as a tool for creating prompts that challenge your character. Think about how the environment can
impact the character's emotional state and use that to create prompts that push them to their limits.

### 9. Give the character a new skill or challenge
Mid-journey prompts can be a great way to introduce new skills or challenges that the character must overcome. Think
about what skills or challenges would be most relevant to the character's journey and create prompts that focus on those
areas.
